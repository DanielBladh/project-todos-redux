# Project Todos

In this project, I was tasked with building a Todo application using React. The goal was to implement features such as adding and removing tasks, marking tasks as complete, and displaying task counts. I used React, Redux Toolkit for state management, and styled-components for styling.

## The problem

I started by sketching out the components and the overall structure of the application. I used Redux Toolkit to manage the state, creating slices for tasks and implementing actions for adding, removing, and toggling tasks. Styled-components were used to style the components and make the application visually appealing. I also considered responsiveness for different screen sizes.

Implementing local storage to persist tasks
Adding due dates and sorting tasks based on due dates
Improving the overall user interface and user experience
